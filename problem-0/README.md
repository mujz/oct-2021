After coming back from a long run, you go immediately to your fridge searching for a banana (since it's a good fruit to eat after running). But your fridge is very messy and has many other fruits, vegetables and frozen foods.

You get frustrated because this isn't your first time searching for something inside your messy fridge. So you decide to solve this problem once and for all by writing a function that helps you locate items in your fridge.

Your function will receive two variables:
- `fridge`:  an array containing all items currently available in your fridge
- `item`: is the item you're searching for in the fridge

Your function must return the position of the `item` in `fridge` if it exists, or `-1` if it doesn't.

You **MAY NOT** solve this problem by using any array library functions like `find()` or `search()` or `indexOf()`. You must implement the solution yourself using a for or while loop.

```
function whereIsMyFood(fridge, item) {

}
```
